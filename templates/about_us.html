    <h1 style="text-align: center; color:aliceblue;"><b> BARCELONA: The Pride of Catalonia</b></h1>

    <p style="text-align: justify;color: white; background-color:rgba(36, 28, 28, 0.507);">
        Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, 
        hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a club"). Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable 
        sports team in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €582.1 million.
        The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del Barça", written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs. Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and garnet
        stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana. 
          
          
          Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España, three Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, 
          as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA 
          Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record five UEFA Super Cups, a record three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin
          Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups. Barcelona was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009,
          2011, 2012 and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches 
          between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.
          Barcelona is one of the most widely supported teams in the world, and the club has one of the largest social media following in the world among sports teams.
          Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d'Or awards, with recipients including Johan Cruyff, as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year 
          awards, with winners including Romário, Ronaldo, Rivaldo and Ronaldinho. In 2010, three players who came through the club's youth academy (Lionel Messi, 
          Andrés Iniesta and Xavi) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d'Or awards, an unprecedented feat for players from the same 
          football academy. Additionally, players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards.
          Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with
          Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA 
          Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup,
          UEFA Super Cup, and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again, winning five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won fourteen 
          trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League
          trophy in 2015 under Luis Enrique, Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.
          On 22 October 1899, Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive 
          response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – Walter Wild (the first president of the
           club), Luis de Ossó, Bartomeu Terradas, Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, 
           and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.[25][26]
          A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903,FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the Campionat de 
          Catalunya and the Copa del Rey. In 1901, the club participated in the very first football competition played on the Iberian Peninsula,
           the Copa Macaya, narrowly losing to Hispania AC, but in the following year, Barça won the tournament, the club's first-ever piece of 
           silverware,[27] and then participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to Bizcaya (a combination of players from Athletic Club 
           and Bilbao FC) in the final.[28] In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to 
           save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not 
           winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, "Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If 
           there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on."[29] Club president on 
           five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring 
           Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.
           
          On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria, a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings,
           the club conducted a logo contest the following year. Carles Comamala won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club
            still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.
          The stadium is regarded as the main element that helped the club grow in the 1910s and become a dominant team,[32] winning three 
          successive Campionats de Catalunya between 1909 and 1911, three Copa del del Rey in four years between 1910 and 1913, and four 
          successive Pyrenees Cup between the inaugural year in 1910 and 1913, which was one of the earliest international club cups in 
          Europe since it consisted of the best teams of Languedoc, Midi and Aquitaine (Southern France), the Basque Country and Catalonia; 
          all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.[33] Notable figures of 
          Barça's first great team include Carles Comamala, Alfredo Massana, Amechazurra, Paco Bru and Jack Greenwell.[34] The latter became 
          the club's first full-time coach in 1917.[35]
          During the same period, the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important 
          symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a 
          part of the club's collective identity.[36] On 4 February 1917, the club held its first tribute match to honour Ramón Torralba, 
          who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2.[37]
          Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped 
          finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new Les Cortes, which they inaugurated the same year.[38] Les Cortes had an 
          initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.[39]
          In 1912, Gamper recruited Paulino Alcántara, the club's seventh all-time top-scorer, and in 1917, Gamper also recruited Jack 
          Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the
           field and soon enjoyed its first "golden age". Along with Alcántara, the Barça team under Greenwell also included Sagibarba, 
           Ricardo Zamora, Josep Samitier, Félix Sesúmaga and Franz Platko.[40] This team won 9 out of 10 Campionats de Catalunya between
            1919 and 1928 and two Copa del Rey titles in 1920 and 1922. In total, during the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats
             de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups
